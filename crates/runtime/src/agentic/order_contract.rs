//! Rules propagated to every actor (root, delegated executor, independent
//! reviewer, receipt hints) are defined here once and referenced from each
//! prompt-generation site. Before this module the same rule was re-worded at
//! independent sites, so a rule added at one layer never reached the others:
//! one live run inflated "one verifiable fact per file" into three invented
//! acceptance criteria, and reviewers enforced them with line-by-line re-reads
//! and rework cycles that burned 300+ steps without a completion request. A
//! rule that exists in one place cannot drift.

/// Task authoring discipline for the root: acceptance criteria restate the
/// operator stated requirements and nothing more.

/// deliverables, never for self-invented standards.
pub const REVIEWER_SCOPE_DISCIPLINE: &str = "Scope discipline: the criteria operationalize the Task objective; rework is permitted only when the submission lacks a deliverable the objective itself requires. Never reject on self-invented standards - if the objective asks for one verifiable fact, do not demand API surveys, line-level hazard scans or structure write-ups; record such observations as notes or post-accept hints instead.";

/// conversations; batch independent work; prefer ranged reads.
pub const EVIDENCE_ECONOMY: &str = "Never re-read a file an accepted Task already read: open its durable receipt with evidence_retrieve (same bytes, hash-verified). Batch every independent read/search into one response or one tool_orchestrate program; prefer ranged reads over whole files.";

/// Objective-review scope discipline. An Objective review settles one criterion;
/// it is not a second round of Task review, and it must come from someone who
/// did not produce what is being reviewed.
pub const OBJECTIVE_REVIEW_SCOPE_DISCIPLINE: &str = "Preserve accepted work and do not repeat Task reviews: an Objective review settles the open criterion only. The reviewer must be distinct from the Runtime-resolved producer of every result it reviews.";
